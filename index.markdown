    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
    <br>
     Thanks for visiting my website. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University. I study how political institutions influence government partisanship and fiscal policy—particularly taxation and redistribution—in response to rising income inequality.  I also have an academic interest in formal models and quantitative methods.
